## Introduction
Mental health support has become increasingly prevalent since 2019; the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All over the globe people had found themselves at an all time low, or at the very least, searching for various ways to keep their mental health in check. Many had found themselves integrating into online communities, an overarching one being gaming. A dataset was compiled in 2015 exploring the relationship between various mental health-related categories and gaming, and although the data may not be immediately recent, it still provides valuable pieces of information worth analyzing.

## Demographics Overview
For easier visualization, a variety of infographics were made based on the data after cleaning. Although there were 11,138 responses taken from 140 different countries, nearly 4000 of the responses had been from the U.S. Additionally, the majority of the responses had been input by males (10463 male responses, 638 female, and 37 other) aged 18 to 21 coming out to be 54.6% of the data, with those aged 22 to 25 coming in second at 33% (ages 26 to 30 made up 9.8%, while ages 31 to 60 were 2.5%). League of Legends was also the primary game for 83.7% of the responses.

## Questions and Results

## Implications/Analysis

## Limitations of Data
The data sampled may not have been representative of the gaming population as a whole. We've noted some potential issues as follows:
- Skewed towards males
- Skewed towards multiplayer games (Kaitlyn)
- Participant age distribution
- Distribution of games surveyed!
    - (MOBA v sandbox)
    - Talk about lack of correlation found between league and non-league - players
- Primarily uses data from the US
- Some responses unclear and inconsistent
- 2015 survey- would be best to renew

## Recommendations for Future Surveys
-Providing set options for categories such as Gaming Motivation and Earnings (more specifically, actually add income number)
- Run survey for longer period of time
- Run survey through more platforms (dataset was primarily reddit)
- Categorizing the games (i.e. FPS, MMORPG, Sandbox, MOBA, etc.)
- Adding more games/game categories (sandbox games like minecraft, simulation games, stardew)
    - Talk about how doing this will allow us to do comparisons that may potentially give statistical significance
